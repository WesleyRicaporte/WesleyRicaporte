# Hi, I am Wesley Ricaporte

I am studying Electrical and Computer Engineering through the CU Boulder and Colorado Mesa University Engineering Partnership Program in Grand Junction, CO. I build embedded systems, FPGA designs, and data projects, and I enjoy circuits and hands-on work. I like turning ideas into working devices with Arduino, ESP32, DE10-Lite, C and C++, Python, and OpenCV.

## Project Highlights
- **Word Indexer** –reads a plain text file, tokenizes the text, sorts words alphabetically, and outputs a word-frequency list with counts.
- **Low-noise ECG circuit design** – instrumentation front end and active filtering for clean ECG signals
- **Computer Vision Toolkit ** - image manipulation using channel ops, color space tools, image embedding and shifts
