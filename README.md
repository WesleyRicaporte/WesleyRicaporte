# Hi, I am Wesley Ricaporte

I am studying Electrical and Computer Engineering through the CU Boulder and Colorado Mesa University Engineering Partnership Program in Grand Junction, CO. I build embedded systems, FPGA designs, and data projects, and I enjoy circuits and hands-on work. I like turning ideas into working devices with Arduino, ESP32, DE10-Lite, C and C++, Python, and OpenCV.

![Verilog](https://img.shields.io/badge/Verilog-B22222)
![MATLAB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MATLAB-F37726?logo=mathworks&logoColor=white)

**Hardware:** DE10-Lite FPGA board, ESP32 DevKit, Arduino Uno, common sensors, motor drivers  

**FPGA and tools:** Intel Quartus Prime Lite, pin planner, basic timing constraints, ModelSim  

**Data and computer vision:** NumPy, OpenCV  

**Tooling:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, Espressif IDE, Arduino IDE

## Project Highlights
- **Word Indexer** –reads a plain text file, tokenizes the text, sorts words alphabetically, and outputs a word-frequency list with counts.
- **Low-noise ECG circuit design** – instrumentation front end and active filtering for clean ECG signals
- **Computer Vision Toolkit ** - image manipulation using channel ops, color space tools, image embedding and shifts
